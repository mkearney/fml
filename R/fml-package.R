#' fml: File Management and Location Tools
#'
#' The fml package provides a streamlined and simplified interface for
#' interacting with files. It serves as a wrapper around numerous base
#' functions e.g., [base::path.expand], [base::file.path], [base::list.files],
#' [base::list.dirs], etc.
#'
#' @section file functions:
#' **File**s are non-directory, content endpoints (docs, text, html, script, data, etc.)
#'
#' @section dir functions:
#' **Dir**ectories are non-file, container endpoints (folders that can contain
#' files and/or subfolders)
#'
#' @section path functions:
#' **Path**s are file or directory endpoints (everything is a path)
